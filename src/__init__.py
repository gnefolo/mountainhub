Initialize the src package.

This package contains all modules required to run the MountainHub backend,
including database models, API routes and business logic services. It is
structured to separate concerns clearly between persistence (models),
REST endpoints (routes) and integration with thirdâ€‘party APIs or business logic
(services). Refer to the README for details on available endpoints and usage.
