"""
Services package.

This package contains business logic that does not belong to the web layer or
the database models. Services can be reused by multiple routes or other
components. For example, the ``external_apis`` module wraps calls to
thirdâ€‘party APIs, and the ``equipment_configurator`` module generates
personalised gear recommendations.
